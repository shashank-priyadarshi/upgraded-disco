# internal/adapters/core/usecases

The usecases directory might contain the following:

- Use Case Interfaces: Define interfaces for each use case to specify the contract and the methods it should provide. These interfaces encapsulate the high-level actions your application can perform.

- Use Case Implementations: Provide concrete implementations of the use case interfaces. These implementations contain the actual business logic for specific actions or features.

- Dependency Injection: Use cases often require dependencies, such as service instances or repository interfaces. The use cases should be designed in a way that allows these dependencies to be injected, making the use cases more modular and testable.

- Error Handling: Handle and propagate errors specific to the use case, providing clear error handling for different scenarios.

For example, if you have an e-commerce application, you might have use cases like:

- PlaceOrderUseCase: Represents the action of placing an order, including validating the order, calculating totals, and creating the order.
- AuthenticateUserUseCase: Manages user authentication, including login and registration processes.
