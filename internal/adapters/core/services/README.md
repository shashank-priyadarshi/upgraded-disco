 contain might contain the follwing:

- Service Interfaces: Define interfaces for each service to specify the contract and the methods it should provide. This allows you to create various implementations for different use cases if needed.

- Service Implementations: Provide concrete implementations of the service interfaces. These implementations contain the actual business logic and may interact with repository interfaces to retrieve or persist data.

- Service-specific Utilities: If a service requires specific utility functions or helper methods, these can be included within the service package.

- Error Handling: Handle and propagate errors specific to the business logic within the service.

- Transaction Management: If the service needs to manage transactions (e.g., in a database), this logic can be included in the service implementation.

For example, in an e-commerce application, there might be services like:

- OrderService: Responsible for managing order-related logic, such as creating orders, calculating totals, and handling payment processing.
- UserService: Manages user-related logic, including authentication, profile updates, and user interactions.
